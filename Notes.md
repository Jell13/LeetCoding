-- DUPLICATE INTEGERS --

use a dictionary as they are very fast in terms of finding whether a key exist or not, find whether or not the number already existed inside of the dictionary, if no then add it in, if yes it means it does exist and we've seen the number before which we are able to conclude that they are a duplicate.
